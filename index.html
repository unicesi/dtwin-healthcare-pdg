      <h1>Towards Continuous Monitoring in Personalized Healthcare through Digital Twins</h1>
      <h3>Abstract</h3>
      <p>Risks associated with the effects of persistent chronic diseases demand continuous and effective monitoring mechanisms. Moreover, particular patient conditions require medical treatments and care to be tailored according to individual needs. However, these considerations impose new challenges on the engineering of systems that support these required capabilities. Research on the application of the novel concept of Digital Twin (DT) in healthcare might provide the means to overcome these challenges. DTs might represent a significant step forward towards the achievement of effective continuous monitoring of chronic diseases and personalized healthcare. This exhibit presents our vision and emerging results in the application of DT practices in the healthcare domain. For this, we will illustrate the relevance of using DTs in the disease management of diabetes.</p>
